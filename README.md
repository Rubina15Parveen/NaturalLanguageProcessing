This repository contains a collection of small assignments designed to introduce the core concepts and techniques in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Each notebook showcases a specific NLP task, and the projects are structured to help build foundational understanding in the field.
-- Files and Projects
      1. N_grams.ipynb
      Implements trigram models using the corpus_for_language_model.txt file.
      Trains n-grams and calculates sentence probabilities using various techniques:
       -- Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)
       -- Laplace Smoothing
       -- Katz Backoff
      Computes Positive Pointwise Mutual Information (PPMI) for word pairs based on the corpus.
      Leverages GloVe embeddings to find the most similar words. GloVe embeddings are downloaded and extracted using the following commands:
        !wget http://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.42B.300d.zip
        !unzip glove.42B.300d.zip
