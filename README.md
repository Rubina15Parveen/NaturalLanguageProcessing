# Natural Language Processing 
This repository contains a collection of small assignments designed to introduce the core concepts and techniques in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Each notebook showcases a specific NLP task, and the projects are structured to help build foundational understanding in the field.
<br> -- Files and Projects
      <br>1. N_grams.ipynb
      <br>Implements trigram models using the corpus_for_language_model.txt file.
      <br>Trains n-grams and calculates sentence probabilities using various techniques:
      <br> -- Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)
      <br> -- Laplace Smoothing
      <br> -- Katz Backoff
      <br>Computes Positive Pointwise Mutual Information (PPMI) for word pairs based on the corpus.
      <br>Leverages GloVe embeddings to find the most similar words. GloVe embeddings are downloaded and extracted using the following commands:
        <br>!wget http://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.42B.300d.zip
        <br>!unzip glove.42B.300d.zip<br>
