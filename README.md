# Natural Language Processing 
This repository contains a collection of small assignments designed to introduce the core concepts and techniques in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Each notebook showcases a specific NLP task, and the projects are structured to help build foundational understanding in the field.
<br> #### Files and Projects <br>
      <br> &ensp;1. N_grams.ipynb
      <br> &ensp;Implements trigram models using the corpus_for_language_model.txt file.
      <br> &ensp;Trains n-grams and calculates sentence probabilities using various techniques:
      <br> &ensp;&ensp;-- Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)
      <br> &ensp;&ensp;-- Laplace Smoothing
      <br> &ensp;&ensp;-- Katz Backoff
      <br>&ensp;Computes Positive Pointwise Mutual Information (PPMI) for word pairs based on the corpus.
      <br>&ensp;Leverages GloVe embeddings to find the most similar words. GloVe embeddings are downloaded and extracted using the following commands:
        <br>&ensp;&ensp;!wget http://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.42B.300d.zip
        <br>&ensp;&ensp;!unzip glove.42B.300d.zip<br>
      <br> &ensp;2.
